        <h2>About us<br></h2>
        <h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
        <p>"Taho" represents a Filipino traditional food staple that comes from ancestral roots rather than functioning as a brand-based modern business operated like a large company. Origins in Chinese Douhua: Sometime during history Chinese douhua evolved into taho as Filipinos adopted the traditional dessert. The Philippines shared a prolonged period of cultural interaction with China according to historical records. Before Spanish rule in the Philippines established trading routes these exchanges had probably occurred naturally. The traditional sellers of taho are known as "magtataho" who operate from streets across the Philippines. They bring two metal buckets that hold soft tofu in one and sweet syrup ("arnibal") together with sago pearls in the other. People throughout the Philippines recognize the regular morning sounds of these street vendors who call out "Taho!" while selling food. 
        The traditional preparation approach stays intact yet entrepreneurs introduce new versions of taho that feature diverse taste combinations and decoration elements. 
        Modern enterprises have adopted traditional taho recipes to create various versions of the snacks that they sell in contemporary food service outlets. 
        The "Taho Story" business presents a contemporary version of traditional taho with the inclusion of ice cream and other decorative elements. Traditional food 
        has evolved into new contemporary forms. Throughout Filipino culture Taho occupies an important position. The food functions as both home-cooking comfort 
        and street breakfast fare and historical Filipino food items. Taho serves as a food item that both high and lower-income classes enjoy equally. 
        The history of taho exists as a tale about cultural exchange and traditional practices and adjustment over time. Taho stands as a permanent symbol of 
        the universal love for a straightforward tasty meal.</p>
